# SQL-Challenge
This repo is for week 9 sql challenge. 
For this challenge, I sketch the ERD for the given csv files using QuickDBD, so the relationships for this data is in table employee, its employee number and employee id linking with the employee number in department manager table, salaries table, and department employee table. The department number in departments table linking with the department table in both department manager and department employee. Finally, the employee title id linking between employees table and titles table.

Then after ERD created, I use the bottom-up approach to create all the tables in pgadmin4 using primary keys and foreign keys for schema creation. Then import the coresponding csv files into each table.
